## Abstract
This IIP introduces the capacity to add __secondary tokens__ to the ION blockchain.

## Plain language tl;dr
__“Add secondary tokens to the ION blockchain”__ — Introduce the capacity to create secondary tokens on the ION blockchain.

* Effect: Token creation functionality facilitates new use cases for ION.
* Effect: ionomy.com assets and gaming assets can be transacted and accounted for on the blockchain.
* Effect: Masternodes facilitate network scaling by offloading token management from the core ION blockchain. Fees for token transactions performed by the masternodes can be distributed to ION masternode addresses and/or secondary token addresses.

## Motivation
* Tokens
  * Introducing secondary tokens on the ION blockchain would add functionality to the blockchain that increase the utility and scalability of the ION network, including an increased functional role for masternodes.


## Specification

### Tokens

This proposal would allow for secondary tokens to be built on the ION blockchain and managed in the ION wallet.
